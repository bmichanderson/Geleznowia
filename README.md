# Geleznowia
Documentation for analyses of genomic RADseq data for _Geleznowia_ (Rutaceae)

This repository contains the scripts used for running all genomic analyses in  
Anderson _et al._ (2023) "Using RADseq to resolve species boundaries in a morphologically complex group of yellow-flowered shrubs (_Geleznowia_, Rutaceae)" (doi: [10.1071/SB23010](https://doi.org/10.1071/SB23010))  

Scripts are located in the `scripts` folder, and R markdown files are in the `rmd` folder  
Some additional files that reflect sample and parameter choices are included in the folder `files`  

Raw sequencing data is available from https://data.bioplatforms.com/organization/bpa-plants under dataset 83666, and demultiplexed data is available at the Sequence Read Archive under project PRJNA947349  

The steps for processing the raw data through to end results can be followed in `Geleznowia_analyses.md`
